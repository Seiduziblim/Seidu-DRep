    "comment": "1.\tAs an active leader in the Cardano Ghana community and a key contributor to Cardano’s decentralized governance, I have been deeply engaged in the development of CIP-1694 and the broader governance framework of the ecosystem.\n\n2.\tOver the past 24 months, I have dedicated my efforts to fostering awareness, education, and participation in governance, from organizing DReps awareness events across Ghana to drafting the DReps Code of Conduct. I have also played a direct role in shaping this Constitution through my contributions to the working groups, the constitutional workshop, and the constitutional convention itself.\n\n3.\tBy voting YES, I affirm my belief that this Constitution provides a robust and inclusive foundation for the decentralized governance of Cardano. It is the product of extensive deliberation, diverse input, and a shared vision for the sustainability and resilience of our ecosystem. This document enshrines the principles of transparency, accountability, and community-driven decision-making—values that I have actively worked to uphold in my leadership and governance efforts.\n\n4.\tA YES vote reflects my confidence that this Constitution will empower our communities, enable a functional Voltaire governance era, and set Cardano on a path toward long-term success. I urge all stakeholders to support its ratification and actively engage in building a decentralized future."
